    <p>Dear , </p>
    <p>Hiring Manager</p>
    <p>I am writing to apply for Back-End Developer advertised on Career Zone. As requested, I enclosed my experience & resume as well</p>
  <p>Technology has been nothing but magic to the world. It feels the same to me since My father bought me my first Desktop since then I was interested in Science & Technology. Internet wasn’t available easily because I grew up in a Village so I used to play offline PC games & I always wondered how games & how softwares are made, always caught my attention. That’s when I decided to become a Software Engineer. Being a Tech Savvy as a kid, my village friends always seeked my help for fixing small problems with their Computers & Later on, in my study years in Canada as well.</p>
    <p>Journey from helping friends in a village to being a Technician taught me patience. Solving problem daily has become a part of my life & that’s what I feel any Engineer’s life is about. With the education & skills I have learnt ,has provided me a comprehensive understanding of this Industry:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Programming Skills : Learning PYTHON from online classes      </li>
      <li> Professional career :  Working at BTS allowed me to have grasp on Fibre & Copper Technology & Facing customers taught me Communicational & Emotional Intelligence skills.
      </li>
    </ul>
      	<p>I am very much interested in Software Engineering & you will see that hunger & passion in my eyes too. This growth oppournity is very appealing to me, & I believe that my strong skills, experience & education make me a competitive candidate.</p>
        <p>I would appreciate the opportunity to get more experience & training & further I can gurantee you that I would be a valuable asset for your company. </p>
        <p>Thank you for your time & consideration. I will be looking forward to speak with you about this exciting opportunity.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Prince pal Singh</p>
